### Hi there 👋 
My name is Sidratul but I'm better known on the internet as **DNAMcKnight** but you can call me McKnight. 

I am a dog lover 🐶, I enjoy a good views and I would climb a mountain for it and I love tea. What else, I used to be good at video games (*not anymore*😭) but I do enjoy spending time with good friends. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing my python projects like this one [Cloudflare Warp GUI](https://github.com/DNAMcKnight/CloudflareWarpGUI)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bunch of things, sometimes anywhere from bash to `C, Javasacript or python` and other times from `ardunos, ESP or raspberry pi`.

- 📫 How to reach me: Discord [DNAMcKnight#4318](https://discord.com/users/310517079642079234)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I'm doing and I just go with the flow.
